TODO:
    - bug fixes:
        - tapping star in 2d detail view opens up like 300 new windows...
        - constellation in 2d detail view is wonky and too small
        - lines checkbox doesn't work
        - I don't think declination display is accurate
            - same with cardinal directions, maybe we just remove them?

    - quality of life:
        - zooming is too extreme in 3d mode
        - individual stars of constellations are too large
        - differentiate between constellation names and star names for display
        - nebulas?
        - galaxies?
        - night mode (everything in red)
    
    - ideas:
        - maybe instead of a separate screen, we just zoom into the constellation from the 3d page and display the info around it
